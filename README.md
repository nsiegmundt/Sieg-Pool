## Overview

This web-app's purpose is to allow my friends and I to play the game we created, called Sieg Pool, more easily and effeciently.

Sieg Pool is a pocket billiards game that is a variation of the classic pool game [Kelly Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_pool). In Sieg Pool, each players is assiged a certain number of balls (usually 2 or 3) that are kept secret from the opposing players. The goal for each player is to keep their assigned balls in play for as long as possible, and to be the last player standing with their balls still in play.

Usually, the way pool balls are assigned to each player for Sieg Pool is to draw numbers out of hat. This way, no one else will see the balls the other players selected. Unfortunately, this method of ball selection is very inconvenient, especially when we try to play the game at a bar or party. So instead I created a web application that automates the ball assignment process for us. No longer do we need to cut up pieces of paper and put them in a hat each time we want to play our favorite pool game!
